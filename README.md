# Independent-Voter-Patterns
An Analysis of Independent voters and their habits, especially in 2016-2020
All Data from Pew Research

## Initial Observations
I see an increase in independents not voting for either major party candidate in 2018 and 2020 as compared to 2016.

## Curiosity
Is there a deepening divide between left and right, and if so, what effect is that having on independents?

### Limitations
This does not account for specific actions such as voting 3rd party or write-ins.
